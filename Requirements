# Requirements

## Stakeholders

* Users of the game
* The markers of the project

## User Storeies

As a player, I want to choose different modes of the game so that I can choose the game's difficulty based on my requirements.

As a player, I want to gain resources through some special behviours in the game, and these resources can be able to trade for different blocks, so it is bit more fun.

As a player, I want to know the direction of my character, so that I can know where it will go.

As a player, I want to have cases or tutorial examples telling me some of special designs of the game.

As a marker for this project, I want to see groups create engaging and well made games, with a good twist that is interesting, and a strong process of development that utilises the techniques taught in this module.

=======

* vs Human or vs Computer

* then settings screen
    * choose how many rounds you want to play
    * how much health each player should have
    * the number of planets

* Points system + shop
* Gravity planets; choosing between moon, mars, earth, etc.
* Interactive terrain (destroyable by certain items in the shop ? )
* solar wind ? like in TANKS, raft wars
* black holes ?

* shooting stars mechanics
    * probabilities to do certain things
    * turn into a planet/black hole (which can be turned off in the settings)
    * gaining points etc

* camera zooms in on the following of an arrow
* whether to do a half and half screen where one side has negative gravity, or multiple planets completely visible on the screen

* player can move around the planet rather than shoot for a move
* moving to other planets ? maybe an item in the shop
* HP bars and blood
* Targets on other planets which give points when shot

* Final screen: player X wins
